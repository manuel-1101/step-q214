## 1. Purpose

STEP-Q214 defines a standardized metadata layer for STEP AP214 files focused on quotation and RFQ workflows.

It enables automated and semi-automated interpretation of commercial and technical parameters for industrial manufacturing.

---

## 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Individual parts
- Assemblies
- Industrial manufacturing requests

It is intended for use in:

- Online manufacturing platforms
- ERP and quotation systems
- CAM-related costing workflows
- Hybrid and manual quotation processes

Excluded from scope:

- Production planning
- CAM toolpaths
- Machine parameters
- Quality inspection planning
- Shopfloor scheduling

---

## 3. Normative References

The following documents are indispensable for the application of this specification:

- ISO 10303-214 — Automotive Design (AP214)
- ISO TC 184/SC 4 — Industrial data

Informative references:

- STEP Tools — STEP Standards Overview
- PDES, Inc.

---

## 4. Base Standard

STEP-Q214 is based exclusively on ISO 10303-214 (STEP AP214).

All geometric and topological data shall conform to AP214.

No proprietary or non-standard entity types shall be introduced.

---

## 5. Design Principles

STEP-Q214 implementations shall follow these principles:

1. Backward compatibility with AP214 parsers
2. No modification of core geometry entities
3. Use of standard AP214 property entities only
4. Machine-readable structure
5. Human-readable values where applicable
6. Clear separation of quotation and production data

---

## 6. Metadata Architecture

STEP-Q214 metadata shall be stored using the following AP214 entities:

- PROPERTY_SET
- PROPERTY_DEFINITION
- DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM

Metadata containers shall be identified by:

    PROPERTY_SET('STEP-Q214', ...)

No proprietary entities or extensions are permitted.

---

## 7. Naming Convention

All STEP-Q214 fields shall use the prefix:

    Q_

Example:

    Q_MATERIAL

---

## 8. Core Field Registry

The normative list of registered fields is defined in:

    spec/fields.md

Only registered fields shall be used in conformant files.

---

## 9. Enumeration Registry

All controlled vocabularies and enumerations are defined in:

    spec/enumerations.md

Only registered enumeration values shall be used.

---

## 10. Validation and Parser Requirements

Validation rules are defined in:

    spec/validation.md

Implementations shall comply with the following principles:

- Missing fields shall not cause parsing errors
- Missing values shall not cause parsing errors
- Missing PROPERTY_SET containers shall not cause parsing errors
- Unknown extensions shall be ignored

Fallback to manual completion is mandatory.

---

## 11. Parser Resilience

Parsers and quotation systems shall tolerate:

- Incomplete metadata sets
- Partial field definitions
- Empty values
- Unknown future extensions

No hard failures shall occur solely due to metadata issues.

---

## 12. Conformance

A STEP file is conformant with STEP-Q214 if:

- Metadata is stored according to this specification
- Only registered Q_ fields are used
- Values conform to defined data types
- No proprietary entities are present

Partial conformance is permitted.

---

## 13. Extensions

Custom extensions are permitted if:

- They use the prefix Q_
- They are documented
- They do not override registered fields

Undocumented extensions are non-conformant.

---

## 14. Intellectual Property

STEP-Q214 is developed and maintained by holydraft.

This specification is not an ISO standard and implies no ISO certification.

No rights are waived by publication.

---

## 15. Versioning

Semantic versioning is applied.

- v0.x — Draft
- v1.x — Stable
- v2.x — Major revision

Backward compatibility shall be maintained within a major version.

---

## 16. Governance

Changes to this specification are managed via GitHub pull requests.

All changes are subject to maintainer review.

---

## 17. Document Control

This document is the normative reference for STEP-Q214.

In case of conflicts, this document prevails over supplementary materials.
