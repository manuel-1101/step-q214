# STEP-Q214

STEP-Q214 defines a standardized metadata layer for STEP AP214 files, focused on quotation (RFQ) and pricing workflows for industrially manufacturable parts and assemblies.

It is designed to work across online platforms, internal ERP/CAM systems, manufacturer software, and hybrid (semi-manual) quotation processes.

Developed and maintained by **holydraft**.

STEP-Q214 is based on and aligned with existing STEP standards and organizations:

## Purpose

Manufacturing buyers and quotation teams repeatedly enter the same information into forms and pricing systems (material, quantity, tolerances, surface, certificates, delivery targets, etc.). STEP-Q214 embeds these RFQ-relevant parameters directly into the STEP file in a structured, machine-readable way.

Goal: enable a reliable, low-friction conversion of technical requests into binding quotations by allowing quotation engines to automatically discover and interpret metadata from STEP-Q214 files.

## Key Principles

- Based on **ISO 10303-214 (STEP AP214)** geometry and topology
- **Backward compatible** with standard AP214 parsers
- **No modification** of core geometry entities
- Metadata stored only via standard AP214 entities (no proprietary entity types)
- Strong **fallback**: all fields are optional; missing data must not cause parse errors
